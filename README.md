## Contents

- `Unification.pdf` — Final paper unifying Taylor, Laurent, Puiseux, Fourier series via FFT  
- `FFT-Unified.cpp` — C++ implementation of iterative-loop FFT and IFFT  
- `result.txt` — Numerical output verifying coefficient extraction  
- `README.md` — This file

## Description

This package presents a unified computational framework where:

- Taylor, Laurent, Puiseux, and Fourier series are treated as one.
- FFT is used to extract coefficients directly—no symbolic integration needed.
- Singularities and periodic functions are handled by the same mechanism.

## Instructions

1. Compile `FFT-Unified.cpp` with any modern C++ compiler (MSVC, g++, clang, etc.).
2. Run the executable.
3. Compare output with `result.txt` or redirect it to a file:
   ./fft_unified > result.txt
